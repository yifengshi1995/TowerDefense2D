# Five Element Tower Defense
The Five Element Tower Defense is a tower defense game with Chinese Taoism theme - "Wu Xing".

# About this project:
This game is builded by Unity Engine with C# scripts.
The game is just finished about 20%. I'm a college student who will graduate next semester so I won't update the game every day. Mostly I update it on weekends or holidays.
I'm a computer science student and I know nothing about drawing. However all the images used by this game is drawed by me. So it looks ugly.
The readme file will be updated when I make any significant changes.

# What is Wu Xing?
"Wu Xing", also known "Five Element", used for describing the relationships of phenomena of world.
It consists of:
 - Metal, "Jin"
 - Wood, "Mu"
 - Water, "Shui"
 - Fire, "Huo"
 - Earth, "Tu"

For details, please check the Wikipedia Page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wu_Xing

# Basic System
It has the idea **"generating"** and **"overcoming"**.
A simple graph can tell you the interactions (image also from Wikipedia):

The resources are also consists of these 5 elements. If you tear the tower down, you will get the element that generated by the element that consumed.
For example, you consume **100 Metal** to build an Arrow Tower, when you tear it down, you get **50 Water**.
Since different element represents different time of the year, which:
 - Wood is spring,
 - Fire is summer,
 - Metal is autumn,
 - Water is winter,
 - Earth is the last month of current season.

So in game, there will always a **dominant** element (specific seconds are just temporary:
 - Start as Wood
 - 20s later, change to Earth
 - 10s later, change to Fire
 - 20s later, change to Earth
 - 10s later, change to Metal
 - 20s later, change to Earth
 - 10s later, change to Water
 - 20s later, change to Earth
 - 10s later, go back to Wood

For each element, the tower will receive different buff (not finally determined):
 - Metal will give towers ability to exchange the attack and defense.
 - Wood will give towers regeneration over time, and range increase.
 - Water will give towers extra damage to enemies on the ground.
 - Fire will give towers extra damage to enemies not on the ground.
 - Earth will give you extra resources back when you tear down the towers.

**Features of system may be added in the future:**
 - More buffs, even debuffs of each dominant element

# Towers:
The tower can only be built on the area specified for each map.
The build area are either outside the road (ranged attack tower),
or on the road (blocking tower).

**Features of different types of towers:**
Ranged towers do not have life point, and won't be attacked by enemy. Will attack any enemy inside their range.
Blocking towers have life point, defense point, will be the target of enemy. Will only attack the enemy on the ground and blocked by it (may vary based on different tower).

Currently only a few towers are determined to show up in the game:
| Name | Type | Description |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Arrow Tower | Ranged | Rapidly shoot the arrow to one enemy. |
| Explosion Tower | Ranged | Slowly shoot the fire ball to one target and cause ranged damage. |
| Slow Tower | Ranged | Average attack speed to slow an enemy down 50% for few seconds. |
| Shielder | Blocker| Block at most 2 enemies. Very Low damage, slow attack speed. |

**Towers may be added in the future:**
| Name | Type | Description |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Healing Tower | Ranged | Heal the blockers within its range. Average speed. |
| Commander | Blocker | Raise the attack of all towers. Easy to be killed.  |
| Generator | Ranged | Increase the speed of resources recovery. |
| Forcaster | Ranged | Change the current season into another. |

# Enemies:
Enemies can be either on the ground or not.
Enemies on the ground will only travel within the road, and will attack the blockers when they are blocked.
Enemies not on the ground will travel all over the map (with specified routes), but will not attack.
Currently the flying enemy are **not coded**.

**Features of enemy may be added in the future:**
 - You get resources when specific enemy is killed.
 - Some enemy can attack even though it is not blocked (such as archer).
 - Enemies may be affected by dominant element.
